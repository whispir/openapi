      summary: Send a message
      description: |-
        Communications are the core of what the Whispir Platform API offers as a service to customers.    
        Whispir has the ability to send communications across 7 different channels in a single API request:  
        - **SMS** - up to 1600 characters per message, premium routes, delivery receipts  
        - **Email** - free email messaging with HTML and Plain Text support 
        - **Voice** - high quality outbound voice calls delivered to mobiles and landlines within seconds  
        - **Rich Messages** - personalised, targeted rich messaging to drive conversations
        - **WhatsApp** - customised WhatsApp messages featuring mutliple content types (__presently only available in AP1 region__)
        - **Twitter** - support for instant publishing to multiple twitter accounts  
        - **Facebook** - simplify the process of publishing to multiple facebook accounts instantaneously  
        - **RSS** - easily generate RSS feeds for consumption by other services

        All communications are driven from the Messages endpoint resources within the API. This endpoint allows a user to perform the following tasks:
        1.  Create and send a new message
        2.  Retrieve a list of previously sent messages  

        * * *

        ### Using Templates
        Messages can simply specify the `messageTemplateId` in the messages request, instead of specifying the entire content payload.

        The message template can then easily be changed (using either another API request or by logging in to the Whispir Platform) and the part of the application sending the messages does not need to be altered.  

        * * *

        ### Callback Parameters

        The callback API allows you to pass in any values (parameters), which you want to be returned as is, included in the callback response.

        * * *

        ### Using Events

        Once you have created an [Event](./openapi.yaml/paths/~1workspaces~1{workspaceId}~1events/post) in the Whispir Platform, the next logical step is to be able to deliver a notification about the event.

        ```json
        {
          "to": "+1000000000",
          "subject": "Event Notification",
          "eventId": "2EE7FEA3343662BE",
          "body": "An event has occurred: @@summary@@. A resolution is required by @@actionDate1@@."
        }
        ```

        * * *

        ### Message Variables

        Whispir allows the use of message variables to dynamically customise the content in a message. Available variables include [Native Tags](#native-tags), [System Tags](#system-tags), and [Custom Tags](#custom-tags). Each of these variables are described in the following sections.

        #### Native Tags

        When sending messages using the Whispir API you can automatically customise your communications including recipients information as part of the message. This is facilitated by the Whispir's native message variables [or native tags] that will be resolved against the recipients MRIs.
        > **IMPORTANT**: the following tags can be included in any SMS, email or voice message. They are NOT meant to be used in rich messages. In this case recipient-specific fields can be populated using the Whispir JavaScript API.

        Contact Tag | Description
        ---------|----------
         @@first_name@@ | Recipient’s first name.  <br/> For example, John. 
         @@last_name@@ | Recipient’s last name. <br/> For example, Smith.
         @@recipient_email@@ | Recipient’s primary email address.<br/>For example, jsmith@email.com 
         @@recipient_sms@@ | Recipient’s primary mobile phone number. <br/><br/>For example, 61400400400. 
         @@recipient_voice@@ | Recipient’s primary phone number for voice calls.<br/><br/> For example, 61400400400. 
         @@pin@@ | Whispir message retrieval service call back PIN (only populated when voice is used). <br/><br/> For example, 1234. 
         @@recipient_role@@ | Resolves to the recipient’s ‘Role’ field.<br/><br/> For example, Manager. 
         @@recipient_additionalrole@@ | Resolves to the recipient’s ‘Additional Role’ field. <br/><br/>For example, Team Leader. 
         @@team_name1@@ | Resolves to the recipient’s ‘Team Name’ field.<br/><br/> For example, Red Team. 
         @@messagelabel@@| Resolves to the label field of the sent message. <br/><br/>For example, Incident #1234. 
         @@messagecategories@@ | Resolves to the list of categories used in the message, separated with commas. <br/><br/>For example, Product Update. 
         
        ``` JSON
        POST https://api.<region>.whispir.com/workspaces/{workspaceId}/messages

        {
           "to" : "John_Wick.1143139@Contact.whispir.sg",
           "subject" : "Test SMS Message with tags",
           "body" : "Hi @@first_name@@. This is your message."
        }
        ```
        ``` XML
        POST https://api.<region>.whispir.com/workspaces/{workspaceId}/messages
         
        Authorization: Basic am9obi5zbWl0aDpteXBhc3N3b3Jk
        x-api-key: your_api_key
        Content-Type: application/vnd.whispir.message-v1+xml
        Accept: application/vnd.whispir.message-v1+xml
         
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
        <ns2:message xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.api.whispir.com">
            <to>John_Wick.1143139@Contact.whispir.sg</to>
            <subject>Test SMS Message with tags</subject>
            <body>Hi @@first_name@@. This is your message.</body>
        </ns2:message>
        ```
         
        The main difference with the examples seen so far is given here by the `to` field of the payloads, where a Contact MRI is specified. This reference allows the Whispir platform to inspect the Contact to retrieve the Contact tags.

        * * *

        #### System Tags

        When sending messages using the Whispir API, you can automatically include system-generated information via system variables. Each of them will resolve to the value obtained when you send the message. Unlike the preceding ones, they don't depend from the Contacts information stored in Whispir, so they can be included also in messages where the recipients are not represented by their MRI.

        System Tag | Description|
        ---------|----------
        @@dd@@| Current day with leading zero. <br/> For example, 08.
        @@mm@@ | Current month with leading zero. <br/> For example, 06.
        @@yy@@| Current year, short form.<br/>For example, 22.
        @@yyyy@@| Current year, long form. <br/><br/>For example, 2022.
        @@day@@ | Day in spoken form.<br/><br/> For example, Wednesday. 
        @@month@@| Month in spoken form. <br/><br/> For example, January. 
        @@hrs@@| Current hour with leading zero, in 24 hour format.<br/><br/> For example, 16. 
        @@min@@ | Current minute with leading zero.<br/><br/> For example, 45. 
        @@date@ | Current date in format (yyyy-mm-dd)<br/><br/> For example, 2022-02-02.
        @@time@@| Current time in 24-hour format. <br/><br/>For example, 16:37. 
         
        * * *

        #### Custom Tags

        Using message attributes and message Templates allows developers to cleanly separate these responsibilities. This is done by combining the message channels being used for the message and the data driving the message.
        Under the operational point of view this solution is achieved with two steps:
        1. Creating a Template including attributes
        2. Using the Template and replacing the values for the attributes

        Whispir’s API customers can simplify their requests by using the message attributes directly from the API.
        Using message attributes allows to achieve flexibility in the communications. With this solution, Developers just need to take care of the data behind a message while the Marketing team can focus on the presentation or messaging channels within the message.
        > Unlike native tags, user-defined attributes require Whispir administrative assistance to enable and are configured at the account level. Please contact your Whispir account manager or the [Whispir Support Team](mailto='support@whispir.com') if interested in using them. Whispir’s API only accepts message attributes containing alpha-numeric ASCII characters.
        We are about to see a full example where an initial fixed message has been adapted to be reusable.

        ```
        Using this message template ID and now using the message attribute @@event_expiry@@, the updated code example (combining the message template and message attribute) is far simpler to implement and is more efficient.

        ### Scheduled Messages

        #### Timezone - Scheduling rules

        Using the Whispir API you can schedule messages to be sent later, both once or repeatedly with the possibility to specify the interval between the sessions. The service is available for SMS, email, voice, rich messages 
        A message is scheduled according to the timezone set in the Whispir account of the user who initiates the message request. This setting can be found in the Whispir Portal under "Settings"->"User Manager"->"View/Edit". Whispir DOES NOT honor the timezone where the sender or the message recipient are currently located in
        For example if the user’s time zone is set to UTC in their Whispir profile then messages are scheduled to be sent as per UTC, even if the user triggers the message while sitting in Singapore (+8). So please ensure that any scheduled communication is sent at the appropriate/preferred time
        Also, changing the user's timezone setting after the message is triggered DOES NOT change the original scheduled time.
        #### Sending messages at a later date

      summary: Retrieve a message status
      description: |
        Whispir will automatically monitor the status of each message after it has been sent to each recipient. Using the message status information, you are able to determine who received the message, what exact time they received it, on what message channel (SMS, Email, Voice, Web, Push Notification), whether they replied to the message, what time they replied, and on what messaging channel.  


          Each message progresses through various states, from Pending to Acknowledged.


        ### Message Status Descriptions

        - **Pending (PENDING):** The message has not yet been processed by Whispir. It is in a queue and will be processed shortly.
        - **Sent (SENT):** The message has been sent from Whispir to the recipient, however, there has been no acknowledgement from the recipient via read receipt that the message has arrived.
        - **Received (DELIVRD):**
          - **Email:** Whispir has received acknowledgement via a read receipt that the message has arrived in the inbox.
          - **SMS:** Received status can mean one of two things for SMS.
            1.  The message has been received by the network and is being processed for delivery to the handset.  
                How long the message stays in this state is up to the telco.
            2.  The message has been received by the handset and confirmed by the telco.
        - **Acknowledged (READ):** Whispir has received an intended response from the recipient, either by reply SMS, Email or Voice prompt
        - **Undeliverable (FAILED):** Whispir was not able to deliver the message to the intended recipient on the specified channel. This may be due to incorrect information e.g. wrong phone number or email address, or due to poor network coverage.

        Using the API, developers are able to access this status information at either a Summary or Detailed level.

        The first thing a developer must do in order to retrieve the status of a sent message is retrieve the message using the API.

        ### Retrieve Summary Status

        Using the links provided in the message response, the user can simply make a new API request to retrieve the summaryStatus URL.

        In the example above, the summaryStatus URL is:

        So the request would look as follows:

        `GET /messages/069BF68E5E0FE99B/messagestatus?view=summary`

        As this is a GET request we don’t have to provide any message body.

        This response states that of the 2 people that were sent the message, both of them Acknowledged it by sending a response.

        Your application can use this information to easily determine the numbers of recipients in each state and show a small graph.

        ### Retrieve Detailed Status

        Similar to the summaryStatus, using the links provided in the message response, the user can simply make a new API request to retrieve the detailedStatus URL.

        `GET /messages/069BF68E5E0FE99B/messagestatus?view=detailed`

        As this is a GET request we don’t have to provide any message body.

        The user can easily use this information to receive a far more detailed status breakdown of (for each recipient):

        *   The name of the recipient
        *   The channel type (SMS, Email, Voice, Web)
        *   The sent timestamp for each channel
        *   The received timestamp for each channel
        *   The acknowledged timestamp for each channel
        *   The undeliverable timestamp (only present when the channel is undeliverable)
        *   The overall status for this recipient (PENDING, SENT, DELIVRD, READ, FAILED)
        *   The information text describing how this message has progressed.

        Once you have processed the status information, the next likely piece of information you will be looking to find is the content of the responses (if any). The section on Message Responses describes how to retrieve this information.

      description: |
        ## Summary Responses

        Using the links provided in the message response, the user can simply make a new API request to retrieve the summaryStatus URL.

        The request for this information would look as follows:

        `GET /messages/069BF68E5E0FE99B/messagestatus?view=summary`

        This request is asking for a couple of things:

        1.  The URL is specifically asking for all of the **messageresponses** to the message with ID **069BF68E5E0FE99B**

        3.  The **View** parameter is specifying that the message responses should be shown in a **summary** view

        5.  The **Filter** parameter is specifying that the filter should not use a response rule, it should show the **default** filter

        As this is a **GET** request we don’t have to provide any message body.

        This response states that of the 2 people that were sent the message, both of them **Acknowledged** it by sending a response.

        Your application can use this information to easily determine the numbers of recipients in each state and show a small graph.

        ## Detailed Responses
        Using the links provided in the message response, the user can simply make a new API request to retrieve the detailedResponses URL.

        The resulting request would look as follows:

        `GET /messages/069BF68E5E0FE99B/messageresponses?view=detailed&filter=default`

        This request is asking for a couple of things:

        1.  The URL is specifically asking for all of the **messageresponses** to the message with ID `069BF68E5E0FE99B`
        2.  The **View** parameter is specifying that the message responses should be shown in a **detailed** view
        3.  The **Filter** parameter is specifying that the filter should not use a response rule, it should show the **default** filter

        As this is a **GET** request we don’t have to provide any message body.

        **Note**:Searching responses will be described further on in this documentation.

        *   The **responseMessage channel** describes the messaging channel that the response has come in to the Whispir Platform via.

        *   The **responseMessage content** describes the actual content of the inbound message.

        *   The **responseMessage acknowledged** shows the date of when the response was received by the Whispir Platform

      description: |
        ### High-Level Response Elements

        **name:** String  
        *   Specifies the name of the file being uploaded. The extension of the file too is allowed to be present in the name. **Eg:** australia-contacts.csv
        *   **Note:** It is advised that names should not contain spaces or special characters other than `-` and `.`. This helps for easier search and also for a valid URL link (especially) in case of public scoped files.
        *   **Eg:** `australia-contacts.csv` is better name convention than `australia contacts.csv` as the latter converts into `australia%20contacts.csv`.  

        **scope:** String  
        Specifies the permission scope of the file being uploaded. The scope defines the access restriction of the resource. It can be only one between:
          *   **Public -** Public files have an addressable URL and are available publicly
          *   **Private -** Private files have no URL and are only available for bulk messaging purposes and for importing contacts.

        **mimeType:** String  
        The mime type of the file that is being uploaded. The type is dependent on the scope of the resource.
          *   **Public -** Public files can be of any mimetype. `text/html`; `text/csv`
          *   **Private -** Private files are restricted to `CSV`, `JSON`, and `XML`

        **derefUri:** The base64 representation of the file being submitted.

        **Note:** When creating a resource, the following conditions apply -

        *   Maximum of 10MB per file being uploaded.
        *   Transactions will have an enforced timeout.
        *   Resources will be available in the Whispir Platform for a limited timeframe (30 days). These will then be automatically cleaned. This will be a configurable setting for Whispir Administrators.

        ### Upload the Resource file via API  
        To upload a file to Whispir’s API, users will make an API call to the /resources endpoint.  
        Applications can use this endpoint to store the source files for dynamic messages. This endpoint can also be used to store any file based data (e.g. images, pdf documents, spreadsheets) for an unlimited amount of time.  

        **Note:** The types of files allowed are - `CSV`, `JSON`, `XML`, Images [`JPEG`, `PNG`], and `WAV`.  

        Information about the resources endpoint is documented in the Resources section of the documentation.

      summary: List resources
      description: |
        Existing resources can be easily retrieved via the GET /resources API call. The response lists all of the existing public and private resources available in the system.

        **name:** String  
        - Specifies the name of the resource. The name is given during creation.

        **scope:** String  
        - Specifies the permission scope of the file being uploaded.

        **mimeType:** String  
        - The mime type of the file that is being uploaded.

        **url:** String  
        - The downloaded link to the resource location. Browsing this link results in a download of the resource.  
        - **Note:** Only available for Public scoped resources.

        **link:** Array  
        - Provides a list of URLs that can be used to manipulate or access the message template.
          - uri - the link to access the message template
          - rel - the descriptor for what the link will do
          - method - the HTTP method to use with this particular link

        ## Filtering search results

        **Note:** when it comes to searching by name, the equal sign must be intended as `contains` rather than `equals`. So, if we search resources with the value equals to `in` we might be given back
         
        **Eg** (`India.csv` and `Indonesia.json` but also `Argentina.csv`)

        ### Filtering By scope

        Resources can be filtered by their scope. This can be achieved by sending in the required scope type in the URL as query parameter. The scope can be one of the allowed scope types.

        *   Public - &scope=public
        *   Private - &scope=private

        ### Filtering By name

        Resources can be filtered by their name. This can be achieved by sending in the name in the URL as query parameter.

        **Note:** The name including the file extension makes it a unique search.

        **Eg:** - &name=australia.csv

      summary: Update a resource
      description: |
        Updating a resource involves the same process as in creating a resource. The process of using one of the format (CSV, JSON, XML) for private and any format for public -> converting to base64 encoded data is the same.  
        The change is doing a PUT to the existing resource URL that needs to be updated. Please be careful that doing an update overwrites the previous resource. There is no versioning available in Whispir for the resources.  
        Any or all of the 4 values can be changed. i.e, name, scope, mimeType, derefUri, but all 4 are mandatory values to be sent.

      summary: Create a response rule
      description: |
        ## Response Template Patterns

        Each Response Rule has a series of **Patterns** that allow the creator to specify what textual content should be matched in the response SMS or Email, and a number that should be entered when IVR (Voice) is being used.

        Each Response Rule can specify as many Response Template Patterns as required.

        Each of the Patterns specified will also dynamically create buttons within any Rich Message that is associated with the Response Rule.

        This provides an out of the box capability to quickly gather feedback from the field using a Rich User interface, and leveraging SMS as the delivery mechanism.

        **Note:** There is no global search feature available where one can search on all the workspaces present in the system (under allowed user permission). So, When no workspace is provided, the search is performed on the default workspace of the user.

        ### Searching for contacts with Custom Fields

        As Whispir supports extension of the default Contact Profile through the use of Custom Fields. There may be cases where users want to search for Contacts that contain these specific fields. As such, the Whispir API supports searching for contacts using these custom fields.

        Any custom field can be searched by adding the custom_ prepended to the name.

        For example, if the field name is **StaffId**, then the URL would search for:

        `/contacts?custom_StaffId=12345`
      operationId: getContacts
      parameters:
        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Api-Key'
        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/limit'
        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/offset'
        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/sortOrder'
        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/sortFields'
        - name: fieldname
          in: query
          description: |
            String Specifies the field name of the contact object. The field name could be any thing as long as it is a valid contact attribute.  
            Example: `http://api.whispir.com/contacts?firstName=Sam`

            type: string
        - name: customFields

        ### Showing Custom Fields

        Whispir supports extension of the default Contact Profile through the use of Custom Fields. Custom fields can support other fields that may be required to be stored on your Contacts, such as Staff ID, Internal Billing Codes, or One Up Manager.

        These custom fields can be configured on any account through a Change Request to Whispir.

        In order to reveal these custom fields on the contact profile, you can use the `customFields=true` flag within your API request.

        Example: `/contacts/AB38CB3EFD38AFDB?customFields=true`
      operationId: getContactsById
      parameters:
        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Api-Key'
        - name: contactId

          description: 'NOTE: once again, the equal sign must be intended as "contains" rather than "equals". So if we search the people whose firstName equals Sam we might be given back e.g. Sam, Samantha, Samuel. Similarly for numbers: if we search Contacts with staffId equal to 1234 we will given back e.g. the contact with staffID equal to 1234 but also e.g. a contact with staffID equal to 98123456. If you need to narrow down please consider applying additional filters'

        The application must provide all the fields during the update request, even if they are not being updated.

        ## **NOTE:** Any missing fields will be automatically removed from the existing record.

        **Note:** You cannot selectively update the contact fields needed as this is a PUT request.

        1.  GET `/contact/{id of contact}`
        2.  Update the contact field in the object to the required value
        3.  PUT `/contact/{id of contact}` the new object

        The response to the PUT request upon success is usually a 204 with no content being provided.

      summary: List distribution lists
      description: |-
        The distribution list is usually retrieved by its id, but one can also search or refer to the distribution list by its name. This feature has to do with the unique name requirement for the distribution list.

        Apart from the name, the description field can also be used to search for a distribution list. While name can be directly used to send in messages, the description is solely for the purpose of search. Once search yields the required result, the mri has to be picked from the selected DL and then used to send the messages.

        Both these operations can be performed by passing in the relevant search parameters in the URL as query params.

      summary: Retrieve a distribution list
      description: |
        A distribution list allows you to associate the following:

        *   **ContactIds** (type:String) is a comma separated list of Contact IDs that you would like added to the list.
        *   **UserIds** (type:String) specifies the Whispir Users that should also be notified when this list is used.
        *   **DistListIds** (type:String) specifies the nested lists that are contained within this distribution list.

        Any or all three of these can be updated via the PUT method along with the DL properties (name, description, location etc).

        The steps usually are:

        1. Create a Distribution List (DL)
        2. While creating the DL itself, you can put in the ContactIds, UserIds, distListIds (nested) so that the DL is created with those values readily placed in.
        3. After the DL is created, if you want to add/update the values, then
        4. Do a GET request to retrieve the specific DL.
           -  This will return you the DL object
        5. Modify the DL properties (name, description, contactIds, UserIds, dlIds, location etc) as needed
        6. Do a PUT request to update the DL details
           -  Successful update gives you a 204 No Content
           -  The contactIds, userIds, distListIds can be passed all together in a single request.

        Note:
        1.  If an existing contactId is again added, it does neither throws an error, nor create two entries. The contactId is just neglected and only 1 record is maintained.
        2.  If the PUT request was successful, the expected response code is a 204 No Content
        3.  For Modifying the Location Information refer to Location Tags for Distribution Lists

      summary: Run a scenario
      description: |
        Running a scenario triggers the communication to the intended recipients. The message (static or dynamic) will be sent on all the provided channels.

        Running a scenario is very simple to do. The specific scenario has to called via a /POST request.

        Step wise example:
        1. Get all the scenarios
        2. Pick the required scenario’s link attribute
        3. Make a /POST call

        Now invoking this scenario is just making a /POST call.

      summary: Create a callback
      description: |-
        Whispir’s callback service can be configured to send simple notifications and some associated metadata via API callbacks to an endpoint of your choice when one of the following events occurs:

        - A message has been replied to
        - A message delivery failure occurred [wrong number or service unavailable]

        > **IMPORTANT**: unlike all the other API endpoints seen so far, Callbacks are not defined at a Workspace level but at a Company level. In other words, they can be referenced from any Workspace of that Company.

        Callbacks are used widely in web applications to transfer information that may become available at some point in the future. These are sometimes referred to as ‘webhooks’.

        The benefits of using API callbacks are:
        - Whispir will instantly notify your callback server when a change has occurred on Whispir platform.
        - You won't need to continuously poll the `/messageresponses` or `/messagestatus` endpoints, so you won't be reducing your API daily cap.
        - Callbacks themselves are on us, so they do not count towards the daily quota limits.
        - Response-based workflows can be built quickly and effectively.

        The following diagram explains the entire high-level process:
        ![API diagram](https://github.com/whispir/openapi/blob/main/assets/images/Whispir_API_diagram.png?raw=true)

        ## Callback endpoint validation
        During callback creation, Whispir makes a `GET` request to ensure the callback `url` provided is valid and available. The HTTP response code returned by the callback endpoint for this request must be `200`. Any other code is considered a failure and the callback creation will fail. This is the only time a `GET` request is made. Subsequent requests (callbacks) will all be `POST` requests.

        ## Configuration tips

        - Always use a domain name for the callback. Do not use an IP.
        - Ensure that your callback server is reachable on the internet. It should not be localhost or an intranet-only application that can't be reached from the World Wide Web.
        - Limit the port to 80 or 443. Do not use any other ports.
        - Depending on the type chosen (‘json’ or ‘xml’) for the Content-Type, Whispir would make a similar `GET` (and subsequently `POST`) call. Ensure that your web server is configured to handle such MIME types.
        - Most importantly, if your application infrastructure is behind a firewall, make sure that the firewall allows an incoming `POST` request.

                            If retriesEnabled is false, then Whispir will only try once and when a failure (non 200 OK response code) happens, it will not retry again

                            When true, it will try every 5 mins for a maximum of 10 times.

      summary: Update a callback instance status
      description: |
        As every call to a callback endpoint is now stored within the calls endpoint, it’s possible that when failed calls are successfully processed through a manual exercise, that these calls will then need to be updated to reflect the current status.

        Take the following example:
        1.  Callback server becomes unavailable
        2.  A message is sent via Whispir with callbacks enabled.
        3.  The Message gets a response, and this triggers the callback
        4.  The callback server is unavailable, so the response is stored with a status of 'FAILED’
        5.  After 24h, the callback server becomes available again. Retries have stopped, so this information will not automatically flow into the callback server.
        6.  The customer writes a script to GET all of the calls stored in the /calls endpoint and process them.
        7.  Once successfully processed, the customer’s script should update the contents of the /calls endpoint to reflect the current status of 'SUCCESS’.

        This process can be facilitated with the use of a PUT request to the /calls endpoint in Whispir.

        To update a list of attempted API calls from the Whispir API you can execute an HTTP PUT using the /calls endpoint on a specific callback.

        Users can specify multiple IDs to be updated using the following notation:

        `/callbacks/:id/calls?id=ID1&id=ID2&id=ID3...`

        This ensures that all callbacks that have been processed can be updated in a single API call, rather than having to make a single API call per callback attempt.

        The PUT request takes a single API parameter in the body

        ### Search or Filter on Activity Logs
        Activity logs can become quickly huge owing to the amount of actions performed. In such cases, to have a proper filtering of data during a GET /activities, Whispir API provides very neat filtering options on the data.

        All filter options are to be passed in as URL query parameters.

        **Note:** The API currently results in a 404 Not Found when there are no activities present in the log for a given search criteria. This should not be not confused with a failed response. But rather as No Data Found.

        Create a new user. Ensure that the necessary permissions are provided to the API account to create or modify user accounts.

        ### Activating a User after the creation

        When created new users are in the PENDING (P) state. To Activate the user, the User must be set to INACTIVE first via a PUT request and then finally set to ACTIVE (A) via another PUT. They cannot be directly set to (A) from (P).

        An user when created is assigned the PENDING status. So, to set the user to ACTIVE, one has to follow the “user state machine” rules. Here’s how we do it:
        1.  POST /users for user account creation. Capture the Location header value which is the unique link to the User record. This is used in Step 2
        2.  GET /users/{userId} for the user object
        3.  PUT /users/{userId} with STATUS set to 'INACTIVE’ - using the user object retreived in step 2
        4.  PUT /users/{userId} with STATUS set to 'ACTIVE’ - using the user object retreived in step 2

        **Note:** The status text is case sensitive. Lowercase or mixed case text is invalid. Always use uppercase.

        Example: active != ACTIVE; inActive != INACTIVE

      description: |
        Retrieve a list of users in the account. The result will only be limited to users with ACTIVE status. User’s with other status will not be listed in the results.

        Once the request is placed, the response will be a list of url’s to each of the users that the API user has access to/or has requested for via the search criteria.

        **Note:** The sample request here shows users from the company the existing API user is associated with. You cannot retrieve users list from outside of your company and users with status != ACTIVE.

        ## Retrieving workspace users
        To retrieve the list of users, the request is made to via GET to `/workspaces/{workspaceId}/users` endpoint.

        By default there will be a limit of 20 users returned in a request.

        The user will use the limit and offset query parameters to determine how many users they would like to receive. (default when not provided will be limit=20 & offset=0)

        ### Searching for users
        Users can be searched for in a given company by passing in valid search criteria. The search criteria usually can be any of the following user elements (field names) and will be sent in as part of the URI as query parameters.
        *   First Name
        *   Last Name
        *   Title
        *   Job Title
        *   Country
        *   Timezone
        *   Organization Name
        *   Division
        *   Business Unit
        *   Department
        *   Team Name
        *   Role
        *   Additional Team Name
        *   Additional Role
        *   Work Email Address 1
        *   Work Mobile Phone 1
        *   Work Phone Area Code 1
        *   Work Phone 1
        *   Status * (see note below)

        **Note:** While searching for users via status, use the short code ‘A’ for ACTIVE, similarly, 'I’ for INACTIVE, rather than the full words ACTIVE, INACTIVE, etc. so, it is &status=A not &status=ACTIVE.

      summary: Update a user
      description: |
        The application must provide all the fields during the update request, even if they are not being updated.

        **Any missing fields, except for the password field, will be automatically removed from the existing record.**

        **Note:** You cannot selectively update the user fields needed as this is a PUT request.

        So the standard process for updating a user record is:

        1.  GET `/users/{id of user}`
        2.  Update the user field in the object to the required value
        3.  PUT `/users/{id of user}` the new object

        The response to the PUT request upon success is usually a 204 with no content being provided.

      summary: Create an event
      description: |
        As Whispir works with each organisation to build out the requirements of the events module, the required fields are minimal. The bulk of the event information is from fields that are generic, and only applicable to the customer that is using the module.

        Events have sub sections under them called as ‘actions’ (maximum of 10). When an Event occurs/is triggered, the related actions are to be performed. Each action has an owner, a set time, and details associated with it. The owner or responsible person for the event could be a /contacts in the system. This ensures that proper communication is sent to the individual based on their preferred channel (message, email, voice) automatically without having to key in the phone, email, and other communication information again.

        The Events module captures information specific to an event so the information can be used in as part of messaging for the duration of the event. The Events module can be customized to accept events and associated information from external systems or to capture more complex information around an event.

        Events are created within a workspace. As they are custom built the information to be captured will depend on your organisations specific requirements. Generally at a minimum an event will have a label, start date, and a status.

        Most importantly, to create an event, one must have the create access for Incident row in the Roles & Permission section of the account settings.

      summary: Create an import
      description: |
        ## Bulk contact import
        The Whispir API will expose this functionality as a two stage process:
        1. Submit contact data within a CSV, JSON, XML payload using the /resource endpoint – which will return a resource ID
        2. Create a new import resource by submitting a POST to the /imports endpoint referencing the resource ID created in step 1.

        These two stages are further explained below.

        Create a resource specifying the contact information

        Applications can upload a valid CSV, XML or JSON resource containing the contact information that will be imported into the Whispir Platform. Whispir will return the resource ID which can be used to import or update contacts within a workspace through the imports endpoint as described below.

        ### Request Structure
        Firstly, the application needs to upload a resource using the Creating Resources.

        The resource that needs to be provided for contact importing should be in one the following format:
        *   XML
        *   JSON
        *   CSV

        Once this resource has been imported with the appropriate mime type, the application can reference this resource within the import request.

        Import a resource using the imports endpoint  

        After receiving a valid resource ID, applications can make a request to the imports endpoint within a workspace and reference the appropriate resource ID. Whispir will then create an import process that will import the specified data into the workspace.  

        Once the application has an appropriate resource ID to use within the import endpoint, the following request can be used to begin the import process.  

        **Note:** Import processes take place asynchronously. Any contacts will be created once the import process starts, and users will be able to utilise imported contacts as soon as each is completed.

        ### Overview

        Whispir’s API provides you with the ability to send a voice message to any landline phone or mobile phone around the world, both via text-to-speech and custom WAV files to be played over the phone

        Whispir’s Voice module can easily connect all recipients to a single bridged call, simplifying your teleconferences and ensuring your message gets through

        Each voice call is made up of three parts:

        - Message introduction: Either Text-To-Speech (TTS) or a WAV file
        - Message acceptance: Asks the recipient to press a button or insert a PIN to hear the message
        - Message content: The concatenation of the message subject and message body. The latter can be either TTS or a WAV file. At the end the recipient will be given the possibility to acknowledge the message.
        <!-- theme: info -->

        > #### Adding pauses
        >
        > Pauses can be added to conference call details using the `+` character. Each `+` represents 1 second. Pauses allow some wait time to ensure the conference call service is ready to accept the account number and PIN.

        ### WAV files requirements

        WAV files can be used in place of Text-To-Speech to provide a custom `header` and `body`.

        Before a WAV file can be used for the Voice module, it needs to conform to certain criteria:

        - All the WAV files combined must not exceed 10 MB in total file size
        - All the WAV files must be a maximum of 8 bit, 8000 Hz, 1ch, 64 kbps
        - If a WAV file is outside these criteria please use TTS instead
      x-examples:
        Text-To-Speech (TTS):
          header: 'This is the introduction, read out to the recipient prior to any key press.'
          body: 'This is the body of the voice call, read out after the key press'
          type: 'Pin:,ConfCall:,ConfAccountNo:,ConfPinNo:,ConfModPinNo:'
        TTS with conference:
          header: 'This is the introduction, read out to the recipient prior to any key press.'
          body: 'This is the body of the voice call, read out after the key press'
          type: 'Pin:7171,ConfCall:1800123123,ConfAccountNo:098711234,ConfPinNo:8181,ConfModPinNo:4242'
        WAV:
          header: ''
          body: ''

            The conference call details of the voice message. Required when no conference call is being used. The minimum string to be used is specified in the example. Read the following section for information on each field.

            The following parameters can be set by specifying the value after the `:` in the `type` string:

            | Field         | Description |
            | ------------- |------------ |
            | Pin           | The access code required to be inserted from the recipient to hear the Voice message after the "header" is over. It can be left blank and then the user will be asked to proceed dialling "1". <br><br> For example, `7171`. <br><br> If the right code is inserted then "subject" and "body" of the Voice Message will be reproduced. The user will be able to dial "1" to replay the message, "2" to join the conference call or "3" to receive the details to dial in later. <br><br> In this last case the details - a Dial-In number and a PIN - will be repeated 3 times. |
            | ConfCall      | The teleconference line that will be used in the voice call. <br><br> For example, `1800123123`. <br><br> It is possible to reference this value in other channels using the **@@teleconf_number@@** custom variable. |
            | ConfAccountNo | The teleconference account or room number that is used in the voice call. <br><br> For example, `098711234`. <br><br> It is possible to reference this value in other channels using the **@@teleconf_account@@** custom variable. |
            | ConfPinNo     | The teleconference room PIN that is used in the voice call. <br><br> For example, `8181`. <br><br> It is possible to reference this value in other channels using the **@@teleconf_pin@@** custom variable. |
            | ConfModPinNo  | The teleconference moderator PIN that is used in the voice call. <br><br> For example, `4242`. <br><br> It is possible to reference this value in other channels using the **@@teleconf_mod_pin@@** custom variable. |

        Whispir allows you to send push notifications to any iOS and Android-based apps

        Setting up the platform to handle push notifications involves some one-time steps and some periodically repeated steps (updating push tokens). See Apps to get a clear understanding of the related steps and endpoints. Whispir doesn't support sending push notifications to device tokens directly. Read more in Contact devices about how to register the device tokens under contacts.

        Response Rules are useful when your Templates require the end-users to select among known responses [for example, Yes/No, Accept/Decline or ranking something from 1 to 5]

        Using Response Rules in combination with Templates allows you to automatically categorise any response to these messages into different response groups for reporting purposes

        Workspaces allow application developers to create new work areas for the varying use cases of their application. For example they can be associated to the different business units of a company, so to silo the data of the different departments. In fact, the information, assets, contacts and actions performed in a workspace can’t be accessed from another one. This allows the applications to be independent and audited effectively with proper permissions and keys.

        Each of these work areas provides different functionalities - such as creating messages, executing scenarios or viewing distribution lists - and can be governed by user permissions. Users can be assigned access to these workspaces to restrict the control of information as needed.

        Every account on creation is given a default workspace called "My Company" but it is possible to create multiple workspaces suited for each application need. There is no limit on the number of workspaces.
