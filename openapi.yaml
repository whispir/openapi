      summary: Send a message
      description: |
        Communications are the core of what the Whispir Platform API offers as a service to customers.    
        Whispir has the ability to send communications across 7 different channels in a single API request:  
        - **SMS** - up to 1600 characters per message, premium routes, delivery receipts  
        - **Email** - free email messaging with HTML and Plain Text support 
        - **Voice** - high quality outbound voice calls delivered to mobiles and landlines within seconds  
        - **Rich Messages** - personalised, targeted rich messaging to drive conversations  
        - **Twitter** - support for instant publishing to multiple twitter accounts  
        - **Facebook** - simplify the process of publishing to multiple facebook accounts instantaneously  
        - **RSS** - easily generate RSS feeds for consumption by other services

        All communications are driven from the /messages endpoint within the API. This endpoint allows a user to perform the following tasks:
        1.  Create and Send a new message
        2.  Retrieve a list of previously sent messages  

        These are described in more detail below:  
        As message resources can exist in the default (My Company) workspace or other workspace, messages have two access URLs:
        - /messages - for My Company Workspace messages  
        - /workspaces/{workspaceId}/messages - for other Workspace messages  

        If your application does not require separate workspaces, you can simply send all messages from the default My Company workspace.
        * * *

        **Using Templates**  
        Messages can simply specify the Message Template ID in the messages request, instead of specifying the entire content payload.  
        The message template can then easily be changed (using either another API request or by logging in to the Whispir Platform) and the part of the application sending the messages does not need to be altered.  

        * * *

        **Callback Parameters**

        The callback API allows you to pass in any values (parameters), which you want to be returned as is - included in the callback response.

        * * *

        **Sending Messages using event data**  

        Once you have completed creating your event data into the Whispir Platform, the next logical step is to be able to deliver a notification about the event.

        ```
        {
          "to": "+1000000000",
          "subject": "Event Notification",
          "eventId": "2EE7FEA3343662BE",
          "body": "An event has occurred: @@summary@@. A resolution is required by @@actionDate1@@."
        }
        ```

        * * *

        **Sending Messages using template and resources**  
        Assuming there is a template that has already been created with stencil as -  

        Now we have the templateId(for content) with the resourceID (for recipients). Using these two key pieces of information, developers can submit an API request to kick off the Dynamic Messaging process.  

        The smsMappingField should be mapped to the column or key that holds the number to which the SMS has to sent to; and the emailMappingField to the email to which the message has to be sent to.

      summary: Retrieve a message status
      description: |
        Whispir will automatically monitor the status of each message after it has been sent to each recipient. Using the message status information, you are able to determine who received the message, what exact time they received it, on what message channel (SMS, Email, Voice, Web, Push Notification), whether they replied to the message, what time they replied, and on what messaging channel.  


          Each message progresses through various states, from Pending to Acknowledged.


        ### Message Status Descriptions

        - **Pending (PENDING):** The message has not yet been processed by Whispir. It is in a queue and will be processed shortly.
        - **Sent (SENT):** The message has been sent from Whispir to the recipient, however, there has been no acknowledgement from the recipient via read receipt that the message has arrived.
        - **Received (DELIVRD):**
          - **Email:** Whispir has received acknowledgement via a read receipt that the message has arrived in the inbox.
          - **SMS:** Received status can mean one of two things for SMS.
            1.  The message has been received by the network and is being processed for delivery to the handset.  
                How long the message stays in this state is up to the telco.
            2.  The message has been received by the handset and confirmed by the telco.
        - **Acknowledged (READ):** Whispir has received an intended response from the recipient, either by reply SMS, Email or Voice prompt
        - **Undeliverable (FAILED):** Whispir was not able to deliver the message to the intended recipient on the specified channel. This may be due to incorrect information e.g. wrong phone number or email address, or due to poor network coverage.

        Using the API, developers are able to access this status information at either a Summary or Detailed level.

        The first thing a developer must do in order to retrieve the status of a sent message is retrieve the message using the API.

        ### Retrieve Summary Status

        Using the links provided in the message response, the user can simply make a new API request to retrieve the summaryStatus URL.

        In the example above, the summaryStatus URL is:

        So the request would look as follows:

        `GET /messages/069BF68E5E0FE99B/messagestatus?view=summary`

        As this is a GET request we don’t have to provide any message body.

        This response states that of the 2 people that were sent the message, both of them Acknowledged it by sending a response.

        Your application can use this information to easily determine the numbers of recipients in each state and show a small graph.

        ### Retrieve Detailed Status

        Similar to the summaryStatus, using the links provided in the message response, the user can simply make a new API request to retrieve the detailedStatus URL.

        `GET /messages/069BF68E5E0FE99B/messagestatus?view=detailed`

        As this is a GET request we don’t have to provide any message body.

        The user can easily use this information to receive a far more detailed status breakdown of (for each recipient):

        *   The name of the recipient
        *   The channel type (SMS, Email, Voice, Web)
        *   The sent timestamp for each channel
        *   The received timestamp for each channel
        *   The acknowledged timestamp for each channel
        *   The undeliverable timestamp (only present when the channel is undeliverable)
        *   The overall status for this recipient (PENDING, SENT, DELIVRD, READ, FAILED)
        *   The information text describing how this message has progressed.

        Once you have processed the status information, the next likely piece of information you will be looking to find is the content of the responses (if any). The section on Message Responses describes how to retrieve this information.

        ## Summary Responses

        Using the links provided in the message response, the user can simply make a new API request to retrieve the summaryStatus URL.

        The request for this information would look as follows:

        `GET /messages/069BF68E5E0FE99B/messagestatus?view=summary`

        This request is asking for a couple of things:

        1.  The URL is specifically asking for all of the **messageresponses** to the message with ID **069BF68E5E0FE99B**

        3.  The **View** parameter is specifying that the message responses should be shown in a **summary** view

        5.  The **Filter** parameter is specifying that the filter should not use a response rule, it should show the **default** filter

        As this is a **GET** request we don’t have to provide any message body.

        This response states that of the 2 people that were sent the message, both of them **Acknowledged** it by sending a response.

        Your application can use this information to easily determine the numbers of recipients in each state and show a small graph.

        ## Detailed Responses
        Using the links provided in the message response, the user can simply make a new API request to retrieve the detailedResponses URL.

        The resulting request would look as follows:

        `GET /messages/069BF68E5E0FE99B/messageresponses?view=detailed&filter=default`

        This request is asking for a couple of things:

        1.  The URL is specifically asking for all of the **messageresponses** to the message with ID `069BF68E5E0FE99B`
        2.  The **View** parameter is specifying that the message responses should be shown in a **detailed** view
        3.  The **Filter** parameter is specifying that the filter should not use a response rule, it should show the **default** filter

        As this is a **GET** request we don’t have to provide any message body.

        **Note**:Searching responses will be described further on in this documentation.

        *   The **responseMessage channel** describes the messaging channel that the response has come in to the Whispir Platform via.

        *   The **responseMessage content** describes the actual content of the inbound message.

        *   The **responseMessage acknowledged** shows the date of when the response was received by the Whispir Platform

        ### High-Level Response Elements

        **name:** String  
        *   Specifies the name of the file being uploaded. The extension of the file too is allowed to be present in the name. **Eg:** australia-contacts.csv
        *   **Note:** It is advised that names should not contain spaces or special characters other than `-` and `.`. This helps for easier search and also for a valid URL link (especially) in case of public scoped files.
        *   **Eg:** `australia-contacts.csv` is better name convention than `australia contacts.csv` as the latter converts into `australia%20contacts.csv`.  

        **scope:** String  
        Specifies the permission scope of the file being uploaded. The scope defines the access restriction of the resource. It can be only one between:
          *   **Public -** Public files have an addressable URL and are available publicly
          *   **Private -** Private files have no URL and are only available for bulk messaging purposes and for importing contacts.

        **mimeType:** String  
        The mime type of the file that is being uploaded. The type is dependent on the scope of the resource.
          *   **Public -** Public files can be of any mimetype. text/html; text/csv
          *   **Private -** Private files are restricted to CSV, JSON, and XML

        **derefUri:** The base64 representation of the file being submitted.

        **Note:** When creating a resource, the following conditions apply -

        *   Maximum of 10MB per file being uploaded.
        *   Transactions will have an enforced timeout.
        *   Resources will be available in the Whispir Platform for a limited timeframe (30 days). These will then be automatically cleaned. This will be a configurable setting for Whispir Administrators.

        ### Upload the Resource file via API  
        To upload a file to Whispir’s API, users will make an API call to the /resources endpoint.  
        Applications can use this endpoint to store the source files for dynamic messages. This endpoint can also be used to store any file based data (e.g. images, pdf documents, spreadsheets) for an unlimited amount of time.  

        **Note:** The types of files allowed are - CSV, JSON, XML, Images [JPEG, PNG], and WAV.  

        Information about the resources endpoint is documented in the Resources section of the documentation.

        ## Filtering search results

        ### Filtering By scope

        Resources can be filtered by their scope. This can be achieved by sending in the required scope type in the URL as query parameter. The scope can be one of the allowed scope types.

        *   Public - &scope=public
        *   Private - &scope=private

        ### Filtering By name

        Resources can be filtered by their name. This can be achieved by sending in the name in the URL as query parameter.

        **Note:** The name including the file extension makes it a unique search.

        **Eg:** - &name=australia.csv
      operationId: getResources
      parameters:
        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Api-Key'

      summary: Update a resource
      description: |
        Updating a resource involves the same process as in creating a resource. The process of using one of the format (CSV, JSON, XML) for private and any format for public -> converting to base64 encoded data is the same.  
        The change is doing a PUT to the existing resource URL that needs to be updated. Please be careful that doing an update overwrites the previous resource. There is no versioning available in Whispir for the resources.  
        Any or all of the 4 values can be changed. i.e, name, scope, mimeType, derefUri, but all 4 are mandatory values to be sent.

        ## Response Template Patterns

        Each Response Rule has a series of **Patterns** that allow the creator to specify what textual content should be matched in the response SMS or Email, and a number that should be entered when IVR (Voice) is being used.

        Each Response Rule can specify as many Response Template Patterns as required.

        Each of the Patterns specified will also dynamically create buttons within any Rich Message that is associated with the Response Rule.

        This provides an out of the box capability to quickly gather feedback from the field using a Rich User interface, and leveraging SMS as the delivery mechanism.

        **Note:** There is no global search feature available where one can search on all the workspaces present in the system (under allowed user permission). So, When no workspace is provided, the search is performed on the default workspace of the user.

        ### Searching for contacts with Custom Fields

        As Whispir supports extension of the default Contact Profile through the use of Custom Fields. There may be cases where users want to search for Contacts that contain these specific fields. As such, the Whispir API supports searching for contacts using these custom fields.

        Any custom field can be searched by adding the custom_ prepended to the name.

        For example, if the field name is **StaffId**, then the URL would search for:

        `/contacts?custom_StaffId=12345`
      operationId: getContacts
      parameters:
        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Api-Key'
        - name: fieldname

          description: |
            String Specifies the field name of the contact object. The field name could be any thing as long as it is a valid contact object.  
            Example: `http://api.whispir.com/contacts?firstName=Sam`
          schema:
            type: string
        - name: sortOrder

        ### Showing Custom Fields

        Whispir supports extension of the default Contact Profile through the use of Custom Fields. Custom fields can support other fields that may be required to be stored on your Contacts, such as Staff ID, Internal Billing Codes, or One Up Manager.

        These custom fields can be configured on any account through a Change Request to Whispir.

        In order to reveal these custom fields on the contact profile, you can use the `customFields=true` flag within your API request.

        Example: `/contacts/AB38CB3EFD38AFDB?customFields=true`
      operationId: getContactsById
      parameters:
        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/X-Api-Key'

        The application must provide all the fields during the update request, even if they are not being updated.

        ## **NOTE:** Any missing fields will be automatically removed from the existing record.

        **Note:** You cannot selectively update the contact fields needed as this is a PUT request.

        1.  GET `/contact/{id of contact}`
        2.  Update the contact field in the object to the required value
        3.  PUT `/contact/{id of contact}` the new object

        The response to the PUT request upon success is usually a 204 with no content being provided.

        The distribution list is usually retrieved by its id, but one can also search or refer to the distribution list by its name. This feature has to do with the unique name requirement for the distribution list.

        Apart from the name, the description field can also be used to search for a distribution list. While name can be directly used to send in messages, the description is solely for the purpose of search. Once search yields the required result, the mri has to be picked from the selected DL and then used to send the messages.

        Both these operations can be performed by passing in the relevant search parameters in the URL as query params.

        - Distribution Lists
      summary: Retrieve a distribution list
      description: |
        A distribution list allows you to associate the following:

        *   **ContactIds** (type:String) is a comma separated list of Contact IDs that you would like added to the list.
        *   **UserIds** (type:String) specifies the Whispir Users that should also be notified when this list is used.
        *   **DistListIds** (type:String) specifies the nested lists that are contained within this distribution list.

        Any or all three of these can be updated via the PUT method along with the DL properties (name, description, location etc).

        The steps usually are:

        1. Create a Distribution List (DL)
        2. While creating the DL itself, you can put in the ContactIds, UserIds, distListIds (nested) so that the DL is created with those values readily placed in.
        3. After the DL is created, if you want to add/update the values, then
        4. Do a GET request to retrieve the specific DL.
           -  This will return you the DL object
        5. Modify the DL properties (name, description, contactIds, UserIds, dlIds, location etc) as needed
        6. Do a PUT request to update the DL details
           -  Successful update gives you a 204 No Content
           -  The contactIds, userIds, distListIds can be passed all together in a single request.

        Note:
        1.  If an existing contactId is again added, it does neither throws an error, nor create two entries. The contactId is just neglected and only 1 record is maintained.
        2.  If the PUT request was successful, the expected response code is a 204 No Content

      summary: Run a scenario
      description: |
        Running a scenario triggers the communication to the intended recipients. The message (static or dynamic) will be sent on all the provided channels.

        Running a scenario is very simple to do. The specific scenario has to called via a /POST request.

        Step wise example:
        1. Get all the scenarios
        2. Pick the required scenario’s link attribute
        3. Make a /POST call

        Now invoking this scenario is just making a /POST call. There is no need for a Content-type header as the payload is empty.

        - Callbacks
      summary: Create a callback
      description: |-
        Whispir’s callback service can be configured to send simple notifications and some associated metadata via API callbacks to an endpoint of your choice when one of the following events occurs:

        - A message has been replied to
        - A message delivery failure occurred [wrong number or service unavailable]

        > **IMPORTANT**: unlike all the other API endpoints seen so far, Callbacks are not defined at a Workspace level but at a Company level. In other words, they can be referenced from any Workspace of that Company.

        Callbacks are used widely in web applications to transfer information that may become available at some point in the future. These are sometimes referred to as ‘webhooks’.

        The benefits of using API callbacks are:
        - Whispir will instantly notify your callback server when a change has occurred on Whispir platform.
        - You won't need to continuously poll the `/messageresponses` or `/messagestatus` endpoints, so you won't be reducing your API daily cap.
        - Callbacks themselves are on us, so they do not count towards the daily quota limits.
        - Response-based workflows can be built quickly and effectively.

        The following diagram explains the entire high-level process:
        ![API diagram](https://github.com/whispir/openapi/blob/main/assets/images/Whispir_API_diagram.png?raw=true)

        ## Configuration tips

        - Always use a domain name for the callback. Do not use an IP.
        - Ensure that your callback server is reachable on the internet. It should not be localhost or an intranet-only application that can't be reached from the World Wide Web.
        - Limit the port to 80 or 443. Do not use any other ports.
        - Depending on the type chosen (‘json’ or ‘xml’) for the Content-Type, Whispir would make a similar `GET` (and subsequently `POST`) call. Ensure that your web server is configured to handle such MIME types.
        - Most importantly, if your application infrastructure is behind a firewall, make sure that the firewall allows an incoming `POST` request.

        ## Callback Retries

        The retriesEnabled flag can be enabled on a callback to ensure that Whispir automatically attempts to retry in the event of a failure occurring.

        When a failure conditions occurs, Whispir will mark the callback server as down and log the attempted callback as Failed.

        This callback will be attempted to be retried after ~5 minutes. If the server is available, the callbacks will automatically be processed through the server, the user doesn’t need to take any further action.

        The following rules apply to Whispir’s automated retries for callbacks:
        *   When a failure to make a callback occurs, Whispir will begin retries ~every 5 minutes.
        *   Whispir will retry any callback for up to 24h.
        *   After 24h, the callbacks will no longer be retried.
        *   If the callback service becomes available prior to 24h, the callbacks will automatically re-process.
        *   If the callback service takes longer than 24h, the user can access the callback information from the /callbacks/:id/calls endpoint.

        An array of calls will be returned to you in the HTTP response body.

        ### Retrieving the list of calls based on their Status
        To retrieve a list of attempted API calls from the Whispir API you can execute an HTTP GET using the /calls endpoint on a specific callback.

        To specifically retrieve the FAILED/SUCCESS calls, one can pass a status query param in the URL.

      summary: Update a callback call
      description: |
        As every call to a callback endpoint is now stored within the calls endpoint, it’s possible that when failed calls are successfully processed through a manual exercise, that these calls will then need to be updated to reflect the current status.

        Take the following example:
        1.  Callback server becomes unavailable
        2.  A message is sent via Whispir with callbacks enabled.
        3.  The Message gets a response, and this triggers the callback
        4.  The callback server is unavailable, so the response is stored with a status of 'FAILED’
        5.  After 24h, the callback server becomes available again. Retries have stopped, so this information will not automatically flow into the callback server.
        6.  The customer writes a script to GET all of the calls stored in the /calls endpoint and process them.
        7.  Once successfully processed, the customer’s script should update the contents of the /calls endpoint to reflect the current status of 'SUCCESS’.

        This process can be facilitated with the use of a PUT request to the /calls endpoint in Whispir.

        To update a list of attempted API calls from the Whispir API you can execute an HTTP PUT using the /calls endpoint on a specific callback.

        Users can specify multiple IDs to be updated using the following notation:

        `/callbacks/:id/calls?id=ID1&id=ID2&id=ID3...`

        This ensures that all callbacks that have been processed can be updated in a single API call, rather than having to make a single API call per callback attempt.

        The PUT request takes a single API parameter in the body

        ### Search or Filter on Activity Logs
        Activity logs can become quickly huge owing to the amount of actions performed. In such cases, to have a proper filtering of data during a GET /activities, Whispir API provides very neat filtering options on the data.

        All filter options are to be passed in as URL query parameters.

        **Note:** The API currently results in a 404 Not Found when there are no activities present in the log for a given search criteria. This should not be not confused with a failed response. But rather as No Data Found.

        Create a new user. Ensure that the necessary permissions are provided to the API account to create or modify user accounts.

        ### Activating a User after the creation

        When created new users are in the PENDING (P) state. To Activate the user, the User must be set to INACTIVE first via a PUT request and then finally set to ACTIVE (A) via another PUT. They cannot be directly set to (A) from (P).

        An user when created is assigned the PENDING status. So, to set the user to ACTIVE, one has to follow the “user state machine” rules. Here’s how we do it:
        1.  POST /users for user account creation. Capture the Location header value which is the unique link to the User record. This is used in Step 2

      summary: List users
      description: |
        Retrieve a list of users in the account. The result will only be limited to users with ACTIVE status. User’s with other status will not be listed in the results.

        Once the request is placed, the response will be a list of url’s to each of the users that the API user has access to/or has requested for via the search criteria.

        **Note:** The sample request here shows users from the company the existing API user is associated with. You cannot retrieve users list from outside of your company and users with status != ACTIVE.

        ## Retrieving workspace users
        To retrieve the list of users, the request is made to via GET to `/workspaces/{workspaceId}/users` endpoint.

        By default there will be a limit of 20 users returned in a request.

        The user will use the limit and offset query parameters to determine how many users they would like to receive. (default when not provided will be limit=20 & offset=0)

        ### Searching for users
        Users can be searched for in a given company by passing in valid search criteria. The search criteria usually can be any of the following user elements (field names) and will be sent in as part of the URI as query parameters.
        *   First Name
        *   Last Name
        *   Title
        *   Job Title
        *   Country
        *   Timezone
        *   Organization Name
        *   Division
        *   Business Unit
        *   Department
        *   Team Name
        *   Role
        *   Additional Team Name
        *   Additional Role
        *   Work Email Address 1
        *   Work Mobile Phone 1
        *   Work Phone Area Code 1
        *   Work Phone 1
        *   Status * (see note below)

        **Note:** While searching for users via status, use the short code ‘A’ for ACTIVE, similarly, 'I’ for INACTIVE, rather than the full words ACTIVE, INACTIVE, etc. so, it is &status=A not &status=ACTIVE.

        The application must provide all the fields during the update request, even if they are not being updated.

        **Any missing fields, except for the password field, will be automatically removed from the existing record.**

        **Note:** You cannot selectively update the user fields needed as this is a PUT request.

        So the standard process for updating a user record is:

        1.  GET `/users/{id of user}`
        2.  Update the user field in the object to the required value
        3.  PUT `/users/{id of user}` the new object

        The response to the PUT request upon success is usually a 204 with no content being provided.

      summary: Create an event
      description: |
        As Whispir works with each organisation to build out the requirements of the events module, the required fields are minimal. The bulk of the event information is from fields that are generic, and only applicable to the customer that is using the module.

        Events have sub sections under them called as ‘actions’ (maximum of 10). When an Event occurs/is triggered, the related actions are to be performed. Each action has an owner, a set time, and details associated with it. The owner or responsible person for the event could be a /contacts in the system. This ensures that proper communication is sent to the individual based on their preferred channel (message, email, voice) automatically without having to key in the phone, email, and other communication information again.

        The Events module captures information specific to an event so the information can be used in as part of messaging for the duration of the event. The Events module can be customized to accept events and associated information from external systems or to capture more complex information around an event.

        Events are created within a workspace. As they are custom built the information to be captured will depend on your organisations specific requirements. Generally at a minimum an event will have a label, start date, and a status.

        Most importantly, to create an event, one must have the create access for Incident row in the Roles & Permission section of the account settings.

      summary: Create an import
      description: |
        ## Bulk contact import
        The Whispir API will expose this functionality as a two stage process:
        1. Submit contact data within a CSV, JSON, XML payload using the /resource endpoint – which will return a resource ID
        2. Create a new import resource by submitting a POST to the /imports endpoint referencing the resource ID created in step 1.

        These two stages are further explained below.

        Create a resource specifying the contact information

        Applications can upload a valid CSV, XML or JSON resource containing the contact information that will be imported into the Whispir Platform. Whispir will return the resource ID which can be used to import or update contacts within a workspace through the imports endpoint as described below.

        ### Request Structure
        Firstly, the application needs to upload a resource using the Creating Resources.

        The resource that needs to be provided for contact importing should be in one the following format:
        *   XML
        *   JSON
        *   CSV

        Once this resource has been imported with the appropriate mime type, the application can reference this resource within the import request.

        Import a resource using the imports endpoint  

        After receiving a valid resource ID, applications can make a request to the imports endpoint within a workspace and reference the appropriate resource ID. Whispir will then create an import process that will import the specified data into the workspace.  

        Once the application has an appropriate resource ID to use within the import endpoint, the following request can be used to begin the import process.  

        **Note:** Import processes take place asynchronously. Any contacts will be created once the import process starts, and users will be able to utilise imported contacts as soon as each is completed.

        ### Overview

        Whispir’s API provides you with the ability to send a voice message to any landline phone or mobile phone around the world, both via text-to-speech and custom WAV files to be played over the phone

        Whispir’s Voice module can easily connect all recipients to a single bridged call, simplifying your teleconferences and ensuring your message gets through

        Each voice call is made up of three parts:

        - Message introduction: Either Text-To-Speech (TTS) or a WAV file
        - Message acceptance: Asks the recipient to press a button or insert a PIN to hear the message
        - Message content: The concatenation of the message subject and message body. The latter can be either TTS or a WAV file. At the end the recipient will be given the possibility to acknowledge the message.
        <!-- theme: info -->

        > #### Adding pauses
        >
        > Pauses can be added to conference call details using the `+` character. Each `+` represents 1 second. Pauses allow some wait time to ensure the conference call service is ready to accept the account number and PIN.

        ### WAV files requirements

        WAV files can be used in place of Text-To-Speech to provide a custom `header` and `body`.

        Before a WAV file can be used for the Voice module, it needs to conform to certain criteria:

        - All the WAV files combined must not exceed 10 MB in total file size
        - All the WAV files must be a maximum of 8 bit, 8000 Hz, 1ch, 64 kbps
        - If a WAV file is outside these criteria please use TTS instead
      x-examples:
        Text-To-Speech (TTS):
          header: 'This is the introduction, read out to the recipient prior to any key press.'
          body: 'This is the body of the voice call, read out after the key press'
          type: 'Pin:,ConfCall:,ConfAccountNo:,ConfPinNo:,ConfModPinNo:'
        TTS with conference:
          header: 'This is the introduction, read out to the recipient prior to any key press.'
          body: 'This is the body of the voice call, read out after the key press'
          type: 'Pin:7171,ConfCall:1800123123,ConfAccountNo:098711234,ConfPinNo:8181,ConfModPinNo:4242'
        WAV:

            The conference call details of the voice message. Required when no conference call is being used. The minimum string to be used is specified in the example. Read the following section for information on each field.

            The following parameters can be set by specifying the value after the `:` in the `type` string:

            | Field         | Description |
            | ------------- |------------ |
            | Pin           | The access code required to be inserted from the recipient to hear the Voice message after the "header" is over. It can be left blank and then the user will be asked to proceed dialling "1". <br><br> For example, `7171`. <br><br> If the right code is inserted then "subject" and "body" of the Voice Message will be reproduced. The user will be able to dial "1" to replay the message, "2" to join the conference call or "3" to receive the details to dial in later. <br><br> In this last case the details - a Dial-In number and a PIN - will be repeated 3 times. |
            | ConfCall      | The teleconference line that will be used in the voice call. <br><br> For example, `1800123123`. <br><br> It is possible to reference this value in other channels using the **@@teleconf_number@@** custom variable. |
            | ConfAccountNo | The teleconference account or room number that is used in the voice call. <br><br> For example, `098711234`. <br><br> It is possible to reference this value in other channels using the **@@teleconf_account@@** custom variable. |
            | ConfPinNo     | The teleconference room PIN that is used in the voice call. <br><br> For example, `8181`. <br><br> It is possible to reference this value in other channels using the **@@teleconf_pin@@** custom variable. |
            | ConfModPinNo  | The teleconference moderator PIN that is used in the voice call. <br><br> For example, `4242`. <br><br> It is possible to reference this value in other channels using the **@@teleconf_mod_pin@@** custom variable. |

        Whispir allows you to send push notifications to any iOS and Android-based apps

        Setting up the platform to handle push notifications involves some one-time steps and some periodically repeated steps (updating push tokens). See Apps to get a clear understanding of the related steps and endpoints. Whispir doesn't support sending push notifications to device tokens directly. Read more in Contact devices about how to register the device tokens under contacts.
